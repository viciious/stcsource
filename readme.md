Maximum Armor: Green, 100.

Special Ability: Ability to build cauldron, heal teammates, infect enemies.

Short Description: Alchemist is a good class in most situations. He has	an ability to heal teammates, and infect enemies. Hi potion adds 10 points to health of teammates. Enemies will become infected or if they are already infected they will become even more infected (it will take longer to get rid of the infection (+15 seconds to infection time)). Poison sceptar is a standart poisoned weapon, which will damage everybody who touches it. Cauldron - an object, which can only be built by alchemist. 

Teammates who touch cauldron will be healed from the infection, burning, restore health or get +100 health bonus. To refill cauldron a friendly alchemist must touch it. All alchemists are immune to infections.

Weapons: Torch, Bombs.

Speed: Slow.

Start Armor: None, 0.

Maximum Armor: Yellow, 150.

Special Ability: Ability to build barrels and then explode them.

Short Description: Barrel man is a very dangerous guy. Imagine a pyro-maniac with strong health and ability to destroy everything moving in given radius... Barrel man can use torch to set enemies (and friends too) on fire. Bombs can be used to eliminate a crowd of people. Barrels is a kind of ancient nuclear-weapon. It's power is great and people standing near barrel while it explodes will 99% die. Others will get hurt depending on the distance from the barrel and obstacles between'em. So, having great abilities to blow up enemies, barrel men can often blow-up themselves. Be careful - you don't have a single chance to make a mistake!

### Knight
Name: Knight.

Weapons: Sword, Magic Sword.

Speed: Slow.

Start Armor: Red, 200.

Maximum Armor: Red, 400.

Special Ability: Ability to put a sheild in front of himself, this sheild protects from spikes, arrows, grenades. Short Description: The slowest and the most powerful class in the game. His armor helps him to survive in situations, when others would die. Shield protects from flying arrows, greanades and nails, but while carrying shield knight can not use weapons and slows down dramatically. Normal speed is restored when shield is not used anymore. So knights are perfect first-line offenders, who can crush enemy defence and save teammates during the attacks. Knight has 2 weapons: two-handed sword and two-handed 	magic sword, which spreads magic rays in 5 directions.

Commands: +shield, -shield

### Thief
Name: Thief.

Weapons: Knife, Grappling Hook.

Speed: Fast.

Start Armor: Green, 50.

Maximum Armor: Green, 50.

Special Ability: Ability to open all doors, including enemy doors, disarm enemy barrels, steal ammo from ballista and other players, pickup all items in almost infinit numbers, invisibility if standing, use grappling hook to move faster.

Short Description: Thiefs are good scounts and spys. Their invisibility can disorganize the enemy team (imagine a thief standing in a flag room invisible and waiting for a good moment to steal the flag = not good!). There are almost no locked goors for thief. Thiefs can even open enemy ammo rooms and steal ammo. Grappling hook is very useful when returning to home base with enemy flag, though it still can be used to attack players. Climbing a wall is a unique ability which thief can use to get himself into places where enemy doesn't expect to see anybody from the other team - very very tough!

Commands: +hook, -hook.

### Wizard
Name: Wizard.

Weapons: Staff, Sceptar.

Speed: Medium.

Start Armor: Green, 50.

Maximum Armor: Green, 100.

Special Ability: Ability to build teleporters to move between 2 parts of the map very quickly.

Short Description: Wizard - class with medium parameters and abilities. He is not fast, but he is not slow too, has enough armor and weaponry to protect himself too. Teleporters could be used to move from the ammo room to the flag (goal) room quickly, or to get into enemy base, while teleporter is active. Teleporter can be destroyed by any weapon of each class. It also takes 2 seconds to reaccumulate the teleporter after the last teleportation.

Wizard regenerates cells during the game.

### Blacksmith
Name: Blacksmith.

Weapons: Hammer.

Speed: Medium.

Start Armor: Green, 50.

Maximum Armor: Red, 200.

Special Ability: Ability to drop beartraps, build anvils with armor, repair teammates' armor.

Short Description: Blacksmith is one of the most important classes in the game. Abilities to repair armor, build ballista are uniqueand very useful. Building an anvil takes only 30 units of nail ammo. During the game teammates can touch the anvil and their armor will be restored to maximum possible amount. Repairing armor takes some time (5 units/second). Players touching anvil can not move as if they are building something. Anvil can not be repaired. Ballista is an automatic weapon which hunts enemy players when they come close enough. Ballista uses shells of its owner for a single shot (it won't fire if there is not enough ammo).

Blacksmith's armor also auto-repairs during the game.

##  COMMON RULES AND TIPS

- To abort building press "FIRE" key and answer "YES" in appeared menu.	Answering "NO" will continue building. Note: during the time when the "Abort building?" menu is active building is paused.
- To destroy your building turn your head towards the building you want to destory type "destroy" in console. If there's no building in front of you - then game will ask if each building you own should be destroyed. 
- If you're dying (burning or infected) and you need of alchemist who can cure you, try typing "saveme" command in the console. Some white sparks will flash around you if there's a frindly alchemist nearby. This alchemist will also hear you scream for help then :)
- To identify an object in front of you type "id" command in console. The game will try to the job for you and then print the results. 
- To vote for a map, which server offers as an optional map type "vote". If number of voted players will be greater than halfed-number of players then server will change the map.
- 'Storm the Castle' also supports Capture The Flag and some of Team Fortress maps. Give them a try!
