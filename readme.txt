  PLAYER CLASSES

-=========================================-


Name: Archer.
Weapons: Axe, Bow.
Speed: Medium.
Start Armor: Green, 50.
Maximum Armor: Yellow, 100.
Special Ability: None.
Short Description: A good medium class. Not being too dangerous in close
	combat, archer can be the most deadly class of the game on far
	distances. His bow can blow off enemy heads and hurt enemies deadly.
	Shot in leg will slow enemy down, headshot will 99% kill him. To zoom 
	in and out use "autozoom" command and hold the "FIRE" key.
Commands: autozoom



Name: Alchemist.
Weapons: Potion, Poison Sceptar.
Speed: Medium.
Start Armor: None, 0.
Maximum Armor: Green, 100.
Special Ability: Ability to build cauldron, heal teammates, 
	infect enemies.
Short Description: Alchemist is a good class in most situations. He has
	an ability to heal teammates, and infect enemies. Hi potion adds 10
	points to health of teammates. Enemies will become infected or if they
	are already infected they will become even more infected (it will take
	longer to get rid of the infection (+15 seconds to infection time)).
	Poison sceptar is a standart poisoned weapon, which will damage everybody
	who touches it. Cauldron - an object, which can only be built by alchemist. 
	Teammates who touch cauldron will be healed from the infection, burning, 
	restore health or get +100 health bonus. To refill cauldron a friendly 
	alchemist must touch it. All alchemists are immune to infections.



Name: Barrel Man.
Weapons: Torch, Bombs.
Speed: Slow.
Start Armor: None, 0.
Maximum Armor: Yellow, 150.
Special Ability: Ability to build barrels and then explode them.
Short Description: Barrel man is a very dangerous guy. Imagine a pyro-maniac
	with strong health and ability to destroy everything moving in given
	radius... Barrel man can use torch to set enemies (and friends too)
	on fire. Bombs can be used to eliminate a crowd of people. Barrels
	is a kind of ancient nuclear-weapon. It's power is great and people
	standing near barrel while it explodes will 99% die. Others will get
	hurt depending on the distance from the barrel and obstacles between'em.
	So, having great abilities to blow up enemies, barrel men can often 
	blow-up themselves. Be careful - you don't have a single chance to make
	a mistake!


Name: Knight.
Weapons: Sword, Magic Sword.
Speed: Slow.
Start Armor: Red, 200.
Maximum Armor: Red, 400.
Special Ability: Ability to put a sheild in front of himself,
	this sheild protects from spikes, arrows, grenades.
Short Description: The slowest and the most powerful class in the
	game. His armor helps him to survive in situations, when
	others would die. Shield protects from flying arrows, greanades
	and nails, but while carrying shield knight can not use weapons
	and slows down dramatically. Normal speed is restored when 
	shield is not used anymore. So knights are perfect first-line 
	offenders, who can crush enemy defence and save teammates during
	the attacks. Knight has 2 weapons: two-handed sword and two-handed
	magic sword, which spreads magic rays in 5 directions.
Commands: +shield, -shield


Name: Thief.
Weapons: Knife, Grappling Hook.
Speed: Fast.
Start Armor: Green, 50.
Maximum Armor: Green, 50.
Special Ability: Ability to open all doors, including enemy doors,
	disarm enemy barrels, steal ammo from ballista and other 
	players, pickup all items in almost infinit numbers,
	invisibility if standing, use grappling hook to move faster.
Short Description: Thiefs are good scounts and spys. Their invisibility
	can disorganize the enemy team (imagine a thief standing in a
	flag room invisible and waiting for a good moment to steal the 
	flag = not good!). There are almost no locked goors for thief.
	Thiefs can even open enemy ammo rooms and steal ammo. Grappling
	hook is very useful when returning to home base with enemy flag,
	though it still can be used to attack players. Climbing a wall 
	is a unique ability which thief can use to get himself into places
	where enemy doesn't expect to see anybody from the other team - 
	very very tough!
Commands: +hook, -hook.


Name: Wizard.
Weapons: Staff, Sceptar.
Speed: Medium.
Start Armor: Green, 50.
Maximum Armor: Green, 100.
Special Ability: Ability to build teleporters to move
	between 2 parts of the map very quickly.
Short Description: Wizard - class with medium parameters and abilities.
	He is not fast, but he is not slow too, has enough armor and 
	weaponry to protect himself too. Teleporters could be used to 
	move from the ammo room to the flag (goal) room quickly, or to
	get into enemy base, while teleporter is active. Teleporter 
	can be destroyed by any weapon of each class. It also takes 2 
	seconds to reaccumulate the teleporter after the last teleportation.
	Wizard regenerates cells during the game.


Name: Blacksmith.
Weapons: Hammer.
Speed: Medium.
Start Armor: Green, 50.
Maximum Armor: Red, 200.
Special Ability: Ability to drop beartraps, build anvils with armor,
	repair teammates' armor.
Short Description: Blacksmith is one of the most important classes in
	the game. Abilities to repair armor, build ballista are unique
	and very useful. Building an anvil takes only 30 units of nail
	ammo. During the game teammates can touch the anvil and their
	armor will be restored to maximum possible amount. Repairing 
	armor takes some time (5 units/second). Players touching anvil
	can not move as if they are building something. Anvil can not be
	repaired. Ballista is an automatic weapon which hunts enemy players
	when they come close enough. Ballista uses shells of its owner
	for a single shot (it won't fire if there is not enough ammo).
	Blacksmith's armor also auto-repairs during the game.

	sparks will flash around you if there's a frindly alchemist nearby.
	This alchemist will also hear you scream for help then :)

	game will try to the job for you and then print the results.
